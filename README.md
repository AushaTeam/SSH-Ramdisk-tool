# SSH-Ramdisk-tool

An ssh ramdisk tool that lets you boot the restoreramdisk for your specified ios/ipados version (FOR CHECKM8 COMPATIBLE DEVICES ONLY!)

For this to work you need macOS catalina and higher, and  xcode installed!

If you have issues with the tool just tell me i will try and fix it :)
