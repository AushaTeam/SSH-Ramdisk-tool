# SSH-Ramdisk-tool

An ssh ramdisk tool that lets you boot the restoreramdisk for your specified ios/ipados version (FOR CHECKM8 COMPATIBLE DEVICES ONLY!)

```
For this to work you need macOS catalina and higher, and  xcode installed!!!

I tried linux but unfortunately kernel64patcher uses a library that is only found in mac. So it doesn't work on linux.

```
Compiling:
```c++
g++ main.cc -o RamdiskMaker -std=c++11
```
If you have issues with the tool just tell me i will try and fix it :)

(I know the code for dependencies is crappy im doing my best learning c++ :) )

Thanks to everyone whose dependencies im using :)
