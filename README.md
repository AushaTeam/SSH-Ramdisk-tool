# SSH-Ramdisk-tool

An ssh ramdisk tool that lets you boot the restoreramdisk for your specified ios/ipados version (FOR CHECKM8 COMPATIBLE DEVICES ONLY!)


Compiling: g++ main.cc -o RamdiskMaker -std=c++11

If you have issues with the tool just tell me i will try and fix it :)

(I know the code for dependencies is crappy im doing my best learning c++ :) )

Im still working on establishing the ssh connection with the booted ramdisk. If you have an idea please let me know :]

Thanks to everyone whose dependencies im using :)
